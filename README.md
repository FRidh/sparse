# sparse

A Python library providing an n-dimensional sparse array class.
The idea behind this library is to provide a numpy-compatible sparse array.

## What works?

* The basic operators
* Basic slicing partly
* Converting from dense to sparse and vice versa
* 

## To do

* Finish basic slicing
* Reverse operators
* In-place operators
* Advanced slicing
* Enforcing dtype
* Cythonize
